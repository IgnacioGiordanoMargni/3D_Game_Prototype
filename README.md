# 3D Game Prototype – Godot 4

A 3D experimental game prototype developed in Godot 4, focused on gameplay architecture, animation workflows, and combat system experimentation.

This repository serves as a technical sandbox for exploring structured game development practices and real-time 3D gameplay systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective of this project is to experiment with intermediate game development concepts, emphasizing system structure and animation-driven gameplay logic.

### Key areas of exploration include:

- Root Motion-based character movement
- AnimationTree State Machine workflows
- Signal-based system communication
- Distance-based enemy behavior logic
- Modular health component design

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- Godot 4
- GDScript
- AnimationTree (State Machine)
- Root Motion
- Signal-based architecture

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The project follows a structured and modular approach:

- Character movement driven by Root Motion
- Animation transitions handled through AnimationTree State Machine
- Signal-based communication between gameplay components
- Health implemented as a reusable component
- Enemy behavior controlled by distance-based conditional logic

While the damage system is not fully decoupled yet, the health component is designed to evolve toward a more modular architecture.

- Health component with UI feedback
- Basic combat interactions (attack, block prototype)

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- Parry mechanic refinement
- Full damage system decoupling
- Expansion of enemy behavior logic
- Combat timing polish and feel improvements
